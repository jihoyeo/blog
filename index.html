I'm an Associate professor in Department of Big Data Application, Hannam University, South Korea. 
I received my Ph.D. from the Cho Chun Shik Graduate School for Green Transportation, KAIST in 2020, under the supervision of Prof. Kitae Jang. 
I pursue multidisciplinary research. In particular, based on various urban and transportation data, 
I am interested in data-driven research that is helpful for smart cities and operation of mobility systems. 
Recent research topic lies in developing deep learning and optimization algorithms that are utilized in mobility-on-demand systems.
